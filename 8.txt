                 - Lazy is just for queries on lists and objects
                   (no extra utilities - do one thing and do it well)
                 
                 - Lazy is 0.2.1

                 - Lazy always wraps your initial object
                   (making it less ideal for small, simple operations)

                 - Don't forget about native JavaScript!

                   Object.keys
                   Array.prototype.map
                   etc
